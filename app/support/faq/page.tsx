    question: 'What is Dog Log and what can it do for me?',
    answer: 'Dog Log is a comprehensive support tool for raising a dog (and later a cat). It helps you track your dog\'s weight, bathroom habits, and medication intake; provides reminders for medications and walks; suggests daily exercise time based on your dog\'s breed; and offers training modules. Future features will include dog park locations, veterinary tips, service provider locations, and the ability to share your dog\'s profile with family members.',
    category: 'Getting Started',
    icon: <MdPets className="w-5 h-5" />
  },
  {
    id: 'getting-started-2',
    question: 'How do I sign up for Dog Log?',
    answer: 'You can create a Dog Log account using several methods: manual registration with email and password, or sign in with your Google, Apple, or Meta (Facebook) account for quick access.',
    category: 'Getting Started',
    icon: <MdSmartphone className="w-5 h-5" />
  },
  {
    id: 'getting-started-3',
    question: 'How do I add my first dog?',
    answer: 'After creating your account, the first step is adding a dog through the add-dog process. You\'ll enter your dog\'s breed, which enables the app to provide tailored information like daily exercise duration, number of walks, and health tips. You can search for the breed by text or use the camera feature (Premium) to photograph your dog for breed identification.',

  },

  // Dog Management
  {
    id: 'dog-management-1',
    question: 'Can I share my dog\'s profile with family members?',
    answer: 'Yes! Each Dog Log user can add up to five additional users to track a specific dog. There are two access levels: Editors (partners, parents, trusted individuals) can modify dog details like weight, breed, and age; Viewers (children, less trusted individuals) can only declare walks but cannot edit information.',
    category: 'Dog Management',
    icon: <MdGroup className="w-5 h-5" />
  },
  {
    id: 'dog-management-2',
    question: 'What happens if I delete my dog\'s profile?',
    answer: 'Only the dog owner can delete a dog profile. When deleted, all editor and viewer access is immediately revoked, and a timer (several days) begins allowing you to reverse the deletion. If restored, all previous users automatically regain access. After the timer ends, deletion becomes permanent and you cannot access any previous information.',
    category: 'Dog Management',
    icon: <MdSecurity className="w-5 h-5" />
  },
  {
    id: 'dog-management-3',
    question: 'How does breed-based tracking work?',
    answer: 'When you specify your dog\'s breed during setup, the system tailors information specifically for your dog, including average food quantity, number of daily outings, daily exercise time, and breed-specific tips. For mixed breeds, you can enter the mix for more accurate patterns. The system also supports camera-based breed identification (Premium feature).',

  },

  // Health & Medical
  {
    id: 'health-1',
    question: 'How do I track vaccinations and medications?',
    answer: 'When entering a medication or vaccine, type a keyword in the search tab. The system identifies the item from a predefined list and provides minimal dosage recommendations based on your dog\'s breed (you can adjust manually). You can set the number of pills, required administrations, and frequency for recurring medications.',
    category: 'Health & Medical',
    icon: <MdVaccines className="w-5 h-5" />
  },
  {
    id: 'health-2',
    question: 'What are medication reminders and how do they work?',
    answer: 'The system reminds you to administer medications and confirm they were given based on the schedule you set. When supply is running low, you\'ll receive reminders to renew the supply or prescription for chronic medications. Vaccination reminders are free, while medication reminders may require Premium.',

    icon: <MdVaccines className="w-5 h-5" />
  },
  {
    id: 'health-3',
    question: 'What is the Medical Record feature?',
    answer: 'The Medical Record feature (Premium) allows you to document your dog\'s medical history inside the app, making it accessible anywhere and to any veterinarian. You can photograph medical summaries for OCR processing, and export the full record as a PDF or QR code for emergencies or when visiting new veterinarians.',

    icon: <MdVaccines className="w-5 h-5" />
  },

  // Tracking Features
  {
    id: 'tracking-1',
    question: 'How does bathroom tracking work?',
    answer: 'Perfect for puppies or dogs with house training issues, this feature logs every elimination event. Tap the "Poop" button and the system detects via GPS whether it was indoors or outdoors. You can also enter stool consistency. After several days, view graphs showing elimination patterns and improvement curves.',

  },
  {
    id: 'tracking-2',
    question: 'What can I track with Dog Log?',
